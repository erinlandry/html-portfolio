<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ever After</h3>
<p>This is my all time favorite movie. Classic take on Cinderlla story.</p>
<h3>Moana</h3>
<p>Adding here because it's Emily's favorite.</p>
<h3>The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast</h3>
<p>I don't know which one I watched more as a kid so they are both going here.</p>
